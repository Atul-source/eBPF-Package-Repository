# eBPF Package Repository

The concept of a L3AF eBPF Package Repository is to create a location where eBPF Programs from any trusted party can be uploaded and made available for others to download.

In the context of L3AF, we define an eBPF Package as a kernel space program with an optional, cooperative user space program.
